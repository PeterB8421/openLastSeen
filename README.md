# openLastSeen
This python script searches folder for seen.txt file and if found, opens next episode of the TV series you haven't seen yet.

To use this script, install requirements.txt. Then execute main.py with the following arguments:
python main.py <directory> [a]

Arguments:
<directory>: Specify directory where the tv series is stored.
[a]: Optional argument to increement episode number. You should execute this after you've seen one episode.

I only tested this on Windows, so this script might not work on Linux.
